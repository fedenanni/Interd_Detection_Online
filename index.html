<h2 id='abstract'>Abstract</h2>

<p>For the first time, historians of universities have datasets that reflect the complete output of academic institutions at their disposal. In order to analyze this unprecedented abundance of sources, scholars have access to a large suite of computational methods that have been developed in the field of machine learning and natural language processing. However, when the intention is to move from exploratory studies to hypothesis-testing analyses, historians need to know the reliability of the techniques that will guide them towards “mining” specific quantitative evidences. For this reason the Centre for History of Universities and Science (University of Bologna) recently established a collaboration with the Data and Web Science Group (University of Mannheim). The goal has been to investigate the performance of different text mining methods for a specific task: the automatic identification of interdisciplinary theses from a corpus of Ph.D. dissertation abstracts. One outcome of this work is a method, which outperforms so far state-of-the-art techniques, based on topic models. Additionally, this work features an extensive quantitative evaluation and error analysis, which will be helpful for interpreting conclusions derived with this method. The method presented here will be employed in a historical analysis focused on understanding the long-term influence of private, national, and European research grants on orienting the research focus of Italian departments towards interdisciplinary research.</p>
