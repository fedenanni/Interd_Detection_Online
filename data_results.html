<h2 id='abstract'>Abstract</h2>

<p>Detecting interdisciplinary practices in academic publications by considering the content alone is extremely challenging. In this paper we investigate the performance quality of different text mining methods for this task over a corpus of PhD dissertation abstracts and we propose a new method that uses lexical and discipline-similarity features to determine if a dissertation is interdisciplinary or not. We show how our solution outperforms the existing approaches for the task. This provides an essential method for historians of academic institutions for conducting diachronic and synchronic comparative studies and for using these results as quantitative historical evidences.</p>
